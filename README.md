# Multi-Agent-Path-Finding
New solution in Multi-Agent Path Finding in High-Density Environments. Original work: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06374 <br>
Different heuristics('manh', 'euclid', 'cheb','octile', 'mixed', 'weighted', 'diagonal') and algorithms(A*,Lazy A* WA*, Bidirectional A*, Focal Search) have been tested. A new algorithm, lazy focal search, was proposed to solve the multi-agent planning problem. A comparison of the original and our algorithm is shown below:
